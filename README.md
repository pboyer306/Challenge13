## Special Thanks
Thanks to my classmates Julia and Erin, who helped me by letting me see how their were set up so I could finish this project (loads of issues getting it to set up and run). Also to ChatGPT for walking me through the numerous Render errors only for me to realize that I was trying to deploy a webservice and not a static site (worked really quick when I realized that).
